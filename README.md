# csmod-source
A easy way to install mods for Counter-Strike: Source, a port of csmod for cs 1.6

⚠️ONLY THE STEAM VERSION IS SUPPORTED BY DEFAULT⚠️

currently also not supporting other drives than the C: drive, but I have a guide on the gitbook to fix it.

project is open source, so you can easily edit it to your liking and configure it to your needs.
